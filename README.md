# Playground Repository

This repository contains various coding experiments and benchmarks.

## Projects

### XOR Benchmark (`xor-benchmark/`)
A comprehensive benchmark script that tests different methods for finding a missing element in a list using various approaches including XOR operations, loops, sets, and NumPy.

**Features:**
- Tests 8 different algorithms for finding missing elements
- Benchmarks performance across different list sizes
- Supports multiple Python versions (3.8-3.12)
- Includes GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Virtual environment setup scripts

[See the XOR Benchmark README](xor-benchmark/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## GitHub Actions
The repository includes automated testing workflows that run on push/PR to main/master branches. Each project has its own testing configuration optimized for its specific requirements.
