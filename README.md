## Projects

### Missing Item Benchmark (`missing-item-benchmark/`)
A comprehensive benchmark project that tests different methods for finding a missing element in a list using various approaches including XOR operations, loops, sets, and NumPy.

**Features:**
- Tests different algorithms for finding missing elements
- Benchmarks performance across different array sizes  
- Includes both implementations in multiple languages (python, c, go)

[See the Missing Item Benchmark README](missing-item-benchmark/README.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## GitHub Actions
The repository includes automated testing workflows that run on push/PR to the main branch. Each project has its own testing configuration optimized for its specific requirements.
